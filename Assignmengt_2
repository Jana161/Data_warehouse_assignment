To design a Data Warehouse for a food delivery app like Swiggy or Zomato, we first need to understand the business requirements and data sources. Here is a possible design for the Data Warehouse:

Fact Table: Order Details
order_id (PK)
restaurant_id (FK)
customer_id (FK)
delivery_executive_id (FK)
order_date
order_status
total_amount
payment_mode
discount_amount
delivery_charges

Dimension Table: Restaurant
restaurant_id (PK)
restaurant_name
restaurant_location
cuisine_type
rating

Dimension Table: Customer
customer_id (PK)
customer_name
customer_location

Dimension Table: Delivery Executive
delivery_executive_id (PK)
delivery_executive_name
delivery_executive_location

Dimension Table: Date
date_id (PK)
date
day_of_week
month
year
Note: We have created a separate dimension table for date to avoid redundancy of data in the fact table and to enable easy time-based analysis.

Primary keys are denoted by (PK) and foreign keys by (FK).

Star Schema Design is used here, as it is simpler and faster for querying compared to Snowflake Schema Design.

SQL queries to generate insightful business metrics:

Total number of orders placed by a customer:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM order_details WHERE customer_id = <customer_id>;

Total revenue generated by a restaurant on a particular date:
SELECT SUM(total_amount) FROM order_details WHERE restaurant_id = <restaurant_id> AND order_date = <date>;

Average rating of a restaurant in a particular month:
SELECT AVG(rating) FROM restaurant WHERE restaurant_id = <restaurant_id> AND month = <month>;

Total revenue generated on a particular date:
SELECT SUM(total_amount) FROM order_details WHERE order_date = <date>;

Top 5 delivery executives based on the number of orders delivered in a particular month:
SELECT delivery_executive_name, COUNT(*) as num_orders FROM order_details INNER JOIN delivery_executive ON order_details.delivery_executive_id = delivery_executive.delivery_executive_id WHERE month = <month> GROUP BY delivery_executive_name ORDER BY num_orders DESC LIMIT 5;

These are just a few examples of SQL queries that can be written on this Data Warehouse to gain insights into the business operations of a food delivery app. The exact metrics and queries will depend on the specific business requirements and data sources.
