Example SQL queries:

Total number of matches played in a season
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Matches WHERE season_id = <season_id>;
Total runs scored by a team in a match
SELECT SUM(total_runs) FROM Deliveries WHERE match_id = <match_id> AND batting_team_id = <team_id>;
Total wickets taken by a bowler in a season
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Deliveries WHERE bowler_id = <bowler_id> AND dismissal_kind_id IS NOT NULL AND match_id IN (SELECT match_id FROM Matches WHERE season_id = <season_id>);
Top 5 players with the highest batting average in a season
SELECT Players.name, AVG(Deliveries.batsman_runs) FROM Players JOIN Deliveries ON Players.player_id = Deliveries.batsman_id WHERE Deliveries.match_id IN (SELECT match_id FROM Matches WHERE season_id = <season_id>) AND Deliveries.batsman_runs > 0 GROUP BY Players.player_id ORDER BY AVG(Deliveries.batsman_runs) DESC LIMIT 5;
